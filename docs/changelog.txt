Entries in docs/NEWS.rst and docs/NEWS-dev.rst are generated from
docs/changelog.txt. NEWS.rst groups entries by stable releases, and NEWS-dev.rst
groups them by all releases (stable and development). For example, an entry
listed under "0.44.05-alpha1" in changelog.txt will be listed under that in
NEWS-dev.rst as well, but under "0.44.05-r1" in NEWS.rst (assuming that is the
closest stable release after 0.44.05-alpha1). An entry listed under a stable
release in changelog.txt will be listed under that release in both NEWS.rst and
NEWS-dev.rst.

changelog.txt uses a syntax similar to RST, with a few special sequences:

- ``===`` indicates the start of a comment
- ``#`` indicates the start of a release name (do not include "DFHack")
- ``##`` indicates the start of a section name (this must be listed in ``gen_changelog.py``)
- ``-`` indicates the start of a changelog entry. **Note:** an entry currently must be only one line.
- ``:`` (colon followed by space) separates the name of a feature from a description of a change to that feature.
    Changes made to the same feature are grouped if they end up in the same section.
- ``:\`` (colon, backslash, space) avoids the above behavior
- ``- @`` (the space is optional) indicates the start of an entry that should only be displayed in NEWS-dev.rst.
    Use this sparingly, e.g. for immediate fixes to one development build in another development build that
    are not of interest to users of stable builds only.
- Three ``[`` characters indicate the start of a block (possibly a comment) that
  spans multiple lines. Three ``]`` characters indicate the end of such a block.
- ``!`` immediately before a phrase set up to be replaced (see gen_changelog.py) stops that occurrence from being replaced.
